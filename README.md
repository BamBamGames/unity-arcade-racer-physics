Arcade racer physics made in unity

Trying to get Burnout 3 takedown sort of physics, with fine control over how the drifting works.
I'm not interested in simulating friction on each tire, instead I'm trying to add predictable drift behaviour that can be fine tuned to make it more or less responsive.
